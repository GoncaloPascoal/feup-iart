```
Fin and Body
------------
E(S) = -(0.5 * log2(0.5) + 0.5 * log2(0.5)) = 1.0

Tail
----
E(S) = -((4/7) * log2(4/7) + (3/7) * log2(3/7)) = 0.985
```

```
Fin 2W 2T
---------
Split Info = 1.0
Gain Ratio = (1 - 0.811) / 1.0 = 0.189

Tail 2B 5S
----------
Split Info = -(0.25 * log2(0.25) + 0.625 * log2(0.625) + 0.125 * log2(0.125)) = 1.299
Gain Ratio = 0.875 * (0.985 - 0.6) / 1.299 = 0.259

Body 5F 3T
----------
Split Info = -(0.625 * log2(0.625) + 0.375 * log2(0.375)) = 0.954
Gain Ratio = (1 - 0.95) / 0.954 = 0.052

Therefore we should pick the attribute 'Tail' for the root of the decision tree.
