**1. a)** `S -> G` ✔️  
**b)** ✔️
```
First -> S
    - S: 0

Second -> B
    - A: 2
    - B: 1
    - G: 9

Third -> A
    - A: 2
    - D: 3
    - E: 5
    - G: 9

Fourth -> D
    - C: 4
    - D: 3
    - E: 5
    - G: 9
```

**c)** ✔️
```
- S (f = 6)
    - A (f = 2)
        - C (f = 8)
        - D (f = 6)
            - G (f = 9)
    - B (f = 7)
        - D (f = 4)
            - G (f = 7) *
        - E (f = 15)
    - G (f = 9)

The solution found by A* was S -> B -> D -> G
```

**d)** The heuristic function is admissible, since it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal node, but it is not consistent. For a heuristic to be consistent, its estimate for every node has to be less than or equal to the estimate for any successor node plus the cost to reach that node. ✔️

For example, `h(S) = 6` but `c(S, A) + h(A) = 2 + 0 = 2`.

**3. a)** Evaluation function: sum of the distances between the cities in the path, this value should be minimized.  
Neighbourhood function: swap the position of two cities (except at the start and end of the path, since these will always be the city A)
```
f(s) = 30 + 35 + 20 + 35 = 120
```
**b)**
```
State 1
-------
T = 50

A - C - B - D - A
f = 40 + 35 + 25 + 35 = 135

(sign is inverted since we are trying to minimize f)
P = e^(-(135 - 120) / 50) = e^(-15/50) = 0.741

0.82 > 0.741 therefore the solution is not accepted

State 2
-------
T = 40

A - B - D - C - A
f = 30 + 25 + 20 + 40 = 115

Accepted, since it is an improvement to the current solution.

State 3
-------
T = 30

A - D - B - C - A
f = 35 + 25 + 35 + 40 = 135

P = e^(-(135 - 115) / 30) = e^(-20/30) = 0.513

0.4 < 0.513 therefore the solution is accepted

State 4
-------
T = 20

A - C - B - D - A
f = 40 + 35 + 25 + 20 = 120

Accepted, since it is an improvement to the current solution.
```
**c)** The randomness in the simulated annealing algorithm attempts to prevent the algorithm from becoming stuck at local maxima. It sometimes makes the algorithm accept worse solutions in an effort to explore more of the search space and increase the chance to find the global maximum. If there is no randomness, the algorithm can remain in local maxima, and if randomness is too high the algorithm can have trouble converging. ❓
