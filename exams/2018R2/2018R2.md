**1. a)**

**Breadth first search**
```
- I
    - A
        - [F1]
    - B
    - C
```
**Greedy search**
```
- I
    - B (h = 1)
    - C (h = 3)
        - [F3] (h = 0)
```
**A\***
```
- I
    - B (1 + 1 = 2)
        - C (3 + 3 = 6)
        - H (3 + 5 = 8)
            - D (4 + 4 = 8)
                - B (8 + 1 = 9)
                - [F2] (9 + 0 = 9)
    - C (5 + 3 = 8)
```

**b)** The heuristic is admissible since it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, that is, at every node, the estimated cost is less than or equal to the cost of the shortest path to a goal node. ✔️
```
h -> heuristic
csp -> cost of shortest path

I: h = 8, csp = 9
A: h = 9, csp = 9
E: h = 1, csp = 2
F1: h = 0, csp = 0
D: h = 4, csp = 5
B: h = 1, csp = 8
C: h = 3, csp = 11
H: h = 5, csp = 6
F2: h = 0, csp = 0
F3: h = 0, csp = 0
```

**c)** Only the A* search finds the optimal path (`I -> B -> H -> D -> F2`, with cost 9), both breadth first search (`I -> A -> F1`, cost 13) and greedy search (`I -> C -> F3`, cost 16) find suboptimal solutions.

**2. a)** We can represent individuals as lists of five integers, where 0 represents eucalyptus, 1 represents oak trees and 2 represents pine trees. Representation of the first individual: `[0, 2, 0, 1, 0]`.  
**b)**
```
Fitness function: 1200 - total_cost - 100 * num_adjacent_same

Fitness of individuals
f(i) = -(8 * 20 + 9 * 10 + 8 * 10 + 10 * 20 + 8 * 10) = 590
f(ii) = -(8 * 20 + 9 * 10 + 8 * 10 + 9 * 20 + 8 * 10) = 610
f(iii) = -(9 * 20 + 8 * 10 + 10 * 10 + 8 * 20 + 10 * 10) = 580
f(iv) = -(10 * 20 + 9 * 10 + 8 * 10 + 9 * 20 + 8 * 10) = 570
```
**c)**
```
590 + 610 + 580 + 570 = 2350

P(i) = 590 / 2350 = 25.1% (0 to 0.251)
P(ii) = 610 / 2350 = 26.0% (0.251 to 0.511)
P(iii) = 580 / 2350 = 24.7% (0.511 to 0.758)
P(iv) = 570 / 2350 = 24.2% (0.758 to 1.0)

Therefore the third individual would be selected.
```

**3. a)** `E(S) = -(0.5 * log2(0.5) + 0.5 * log2(0.5)) = 1.0` ✔️  
**b)** ✔️
```
Split Infos
-----------
Shape = -(0.625 * log2(0.625) + 0.375 * log2(0.375)) = 0.954
Color = -(0.75 * log2(0.75) + 0.25 * log2(0.25)) = 0.811
NumEyes = -(0.25 * log2(0.25) + 0.25 * log2(0.25) + 0.5 * log2(0.5)) = 1.5

Gain Ratios
-----------
Shape = (1 - 0.951) / 0.954 = 0.051
Color = (1 - 0.688) / 0.811 = 0.385
NumEyes = (1- 0.655) / 1.5 = 0.230

Therefore the Color attribute would be placed at the root of the decision tree.
```
**c)** ✔️

By using a `{1}, {2, 3}` split for the NumEyes attribute, we can classify all aliens correctly.

**d)** ✔️

![](2018R2_3d.png)

```
Error ratios
------------
Color -> Green: (2 + 1) / (6 + 2) = 0.375
Color -> Red: (0 + 1) / (2 + 2) = 0.25
```

**4. a)**  
**b)** Simulated annealing is a metaheuristic that attempts to find the global maximum of a function and avoid getting stuck at local maxima. It uses the concept of temperature: when the algorithm begins, the temperature is high, so there is a higher probability of accepting solutions that are worse than the current solution. Over time, the temperature decreases and with it the probability of accepting worse solutions.  
**c)** The cuts made are `F`, `CH` and `DJ`.
