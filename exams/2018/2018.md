**c)**

**4. a)** An admissible heuristic never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal state (the estimated cost is always less than or equal to the predicted cost). A consistent heuristic is a heuristic whose estimate is always less than or equal to the estimated distance of any successor to the goal plus the true cost of reaching the successor (H(node) <= H(successor) + cost(node, successor)). All consistent heuristics are also admissible but not all admissible heuristics are consistent. 

**c)** The probability of accepting the new state is 2.35%. ✔️
```
delta = 12 - 15 = -3
prob = e^(delta / T) = e^(-3 / 0.8) = e^(-3.75) = 0.0235 = 2.35%
```

**e)** ✔️
```
A = 2 * B <=> B = A / 2
B = C <=> C = A / 2

p(A) = 0.5
p(B) = 0.25
p(C) = 0.25

E(S) = -(0.5 * log2(0.5) + 0.25 * log2(0.25) + 0.25 * log2(0.25)) = 1.5
