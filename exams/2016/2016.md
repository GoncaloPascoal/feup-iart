**2. a)** `E(S) = -(0.4 * log2(0.4) + 0.2 * log2(0.2) + 0.4 * log2(0.4)) = 1.522` ✔️  
**b)**
```
Split Infos

Rank = -(0.5 * log2(0.5) + 0.5 * log2(0.5)) = 1.0
Type = -(0.5 * log2(0.5) + 0.3 * log2(0.3) + 0.2 * log2(0.2)) = 1.485
Competition = -(0.5 * log2(0.5) + 0.3 * log2(0.3) + 0.2 * log2(0.2)) = 1.485
Weather = -(0.4 * log2(0.4) + 0.4 * log2(0.4) + 0.2 * log2(0.2)) = 1.522

Gain Ratios

Rank = (1.522 - 1.522) / 1.0 = 0
Type = (1.522 - 1.036) / 1.485 = 0.327
Competition = (1.522 - 1.161) / 1.485 = 0.243
Weather = (1.522 - 1.2) / 1.522 = 0.211

Therefore the attribute that maximizes the gain ratio is Game Type.
